Custom Wordpress portfolio theme.

![Portfolio Hero Image](https://nickmurphy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NM-Hero.jpg)

An evolving codebase for my personal Wordpress theme. I have put an emphasis on timeless design to minimize the amount of redesign work and let the content take center stage. Project pages and blog posts take advantage of Wordpress' content modules to speed up publication times.

## To Be Continued
- Add page transition animations
- Create an integrated system for managing projects (tiles/slides)
- Parallax scroll performance improvements
- Homepage UI updates
